## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.11+
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- `virtualenv` (optional, but recommended)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AgentSync.git
 cd AgentSync
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```sh
 python -m venv venv
 source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
```sh
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ After installing requirements.
```
mkdir cred_files
cp .env.example .env
```
Then, update .env with their keys and place their credential files inside cred_files/.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables


Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your credentials. Example:
```sh
 GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
 GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE=cred_files/google_service_cred.json
 CLIENT_SECRET_FILE=cred_files/client_secret.json
 SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id
 GMAIL_USER_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
 HUNTER_API_KEY=your_hunter_api_key
 CHECK_INTERVAL=60
 OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Add Google Credentials Files
Since credentials are user-specific, place your Google API credential files in the `cred_files/` directory:
```
AgentSync/
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ cred_files/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ google_service_cred.json
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client_secret.json
```
These files must be manually added by the user.
##### For more guidance on credentials setup, refer to [Environment Setup Doc](documents/env_setup.md).

###  Install the Package(Optional)
```sh
pip install .
```
----
## Usage
Create a supervisor agent, modify tools, and customize agents based on your requirements.

### Example: Sending an Email using AgentSync
Below is an example demonstrating how AgentSync can generate and send an email using an AI-powered supervisor agent.

#### **Code Example**-> 
Email_sender.py
```python
from typing import Annotated
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from agentsync.AgentCreator import AgentCreator
from agentsync.SupervisorCreator import SupervisorCreator
from agentsync.tools.gmail_tool import GmailTool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from prompt import EMAIL_CREATOR_PROMPT, SUPERVISOR_PROMPT

load_dotenv()
## Load model
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Tool for sending summary
@tool
def send_email(
    recipient: Annotated[str, "This is the recipient's email address."],
    subject: Annotated[str, "This is the subject of the email."],
    content: Annotated[str, "Content of the email generated by LLM."]
) -> str:
    """Sends an email to a specific recipient. Content is generated by the supervisor agent.
    After execution, output should be the email content and a success or failure message.
    """
    gmail = GmailTool()
    
    if gmail.send_email(recipient, subject, content):
        return f"{content}\n\nüì© Email successfully sent to {recipient}."
    else:
        return f"‚ùå Failed to send email to {recipient}."

def main():
    agent_creator = AgentCreator()
    supervisor_creator = SupervisorCreator()
    
    agent_a = agent_creator.create_agent(
        model=model,
        tools=[send_email],
        name="Email_process",
        prompt=EMAIL_CREATOR_PROMPT
    )
    
    supervisor = supervisor_creator.create_supervisor(
        agents=[agent_a],
        model=model,
        tools=[],
        prompt=SUPERVISOR_PROMPT,
        output_mode="last_message"
    )
    
    app = supervisor.compile()

    instruction= """You are responsible for automating email generation and sending the generated email to mdsazzad1779@gmail.com. Execute the following steps in the correct order, utilizing the appropriate agents and tools:"""
    user_message = {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": instruction
            }
        ]
    }
    print("Running Email Generation Automation...")
    result = app.invoke(user_message)

    print("\nEmail Generation Execution Completed. Summary:")
    for m in result["messages"]:
        m.pretty_print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
 Modify the **instruction** and **prompt** to full fill your requirements.

### **Defining Prompts**
To modify the behavior of the AI agents, edit `prompt.py`:
```python
EMAIL_CREATOR_PROMPT = """Generate a professional email for a job application. Keep it clear, concise, and polite, with a professional tone. Include a subject line and closing. Adapt the tone for formal communication.
The second step is to create a subject for the email and send it to the specific recipient.
"""

SUPERVISOR_PROMPT = """
You are a Supervisor Agent responsible for managing and overseeing multiple task-specific agents. Your role includes delegating tasks, reviewing outputs, and ensuring quality and consistency. You coordinate agents like the 'Email Creator Agent' to generate professional emails, ensuring clarity, professionalism, and proper formatting.

When given a request, analyze it and assign the appropriate agent. If refinement is needed, provide feedback to improve the output. Maintain a professional, efficient, and user-friendly workflow.

Ensure all responses align with the intended purpose, audience, and tone. If a request is unclear, seek clarification before proceeding.
"""
```

### Test
```sh
python Email_sender.py
```
